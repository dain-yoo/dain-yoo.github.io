Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Georgetown University. 

My research interest lies at the intersection of political violence (including terrorism and state repression), authoritarian resilience and public opinion. My dissertation project, "Dictatorâ€™s Instrument for Security or Repression? Anti-Terror Law, Political Framing and Popular Support in Nondemocracies," investigates the conditions under which repressive state response to security threats may induce popular support and outgroup bias in nondemocratic contexts. With a focus on Egypt and Tunisia, I examine how identifiability of targeted outgroups can reduce uncertainty of being subject to repression among ingroups, resulting in an increase in support for potentially repressive policies. 

In my broader research, I explore the impact of observing mass demonstrations on political attitudes, economic impact of terrorism and the diffusion of democratic backsliding.

I hold an MA in International Relations from Seoul National University and a BA in Arabic and Political Science from Binghamton University.
