Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Georgetown University. 

My research interest lies at the intersection of political violence, authoritarian resilience and public opinion. My dissertation project, "Between Two Terrors: Anti-Terrorism Law, Political Framing, and Popular Support in Nondemocracies," investigates the conditions under which framing of targeted repression induce passive support for repressive policies in nondemocratic contexts. In my broader research, I explore the impact of observing mass demonstrations on political trust, economic impact of terrorism and democratic backsliding.

My research article has been recently published in [_International Interactions_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03050629.2024.2374364).

I hold an MA in International Relations from Seoul National University and a BA in Arabic and Political Science from Binghamton University.
