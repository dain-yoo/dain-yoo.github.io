Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor of International Relations at Bilkent University, Ankara.

My research interest lies at the intersection of authoritarianism, political violence, and public opinion. My dissertation explores the political consequences of vague anti-terrorism laws in autocracies, using a novel measurement of semantic vagueness in definitions of terrorism in domestic counterterrorism legislation, with a regional focus on the Middle East and North Africa. In my broader research, I explore the consequences of political violence and the international diffusion of autocratic governance, using multiple research methods, such as survey and text analysis.

My works are published in [_International Interactions_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03050629.2024.2374364) and [_Democratization_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2024.2434662#d1e314).

I hold a Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University, M.A. in International Relations from Seoul National University, and a B.A. in Arabic and Political Science from Binghamton University.
