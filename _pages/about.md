Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Georgetown University. 

My research interest lies at the intersection of political violence (including terrorism and state repression), framing and public opinion. I am currently working on my dissertation, "Dictatorâ€™s Instrument for Security or Repression? Anti-Terror Law, Political Framing and Popular Support in Nondemocracies," which investigates the conditions under which repressive state response to security threats may trigger popular support in nondemocratic contexts. With a regional focus in Egypt and Tunisia, I examine how the "identifiability" of targeted outgroups can reduce uncertainty among ingroups, resulting in an increase in support for repressive policies. 

In my broader research, I also study the impact of observing mass demonstrations on political attitudes, how terrorism shapes the size of the shadow economy and the diffusion of democratic backsliding.

I hold an MA in International Relations from Seoul National University and a BA in Arabic and Political Science from Binghamton University.
