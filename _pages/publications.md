## Working Papers (Under Review)
* **The Invisible Impact of Conflict: A Study of Terrorism, Regime Type and the Shadow Economy (with Da Sul Kim, _Accepted at International Interactions_)**
  :   Does terrorism contribute to the growth of the shadow economy? Employing data on terrorism and the shadow economies of 116 countries from 1990 to 2017, we demonstrate that terrorism results in an increase in the size of the shadow economy and that the effect is larger in autocracies. We argue that political instability caused by terrorism leads to the erosion of institutional trust and social capital. Furthermore, ineffective and repressive counterterrorism measures in autocracies further hamper the economic pursuits of individuals, businesses, and foreign investors, which facilitates engagement in informal economic activities. We use the generalized method of moments to deal with the endogeneity, which supports the findings.
