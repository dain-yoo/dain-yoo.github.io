## Dissertation Project
* **Dictator’s Instrument for Security or Repression? Anti-Terror Law, Political Framing and Popular Support in Nondemocracies**
  :   Why do some anti-terror laws (ATLs) lend themselves to repression more than others? While numerous journalistic accounts denounce autocrats’ frequent use of _vaguely drafted_ security laws against political dissidents or ethno-religious minorities, systematic study of “vaguely drafted” ATLs and its association with increased repression is limited. I contend that the adoption of ATLs, followed by political framing of repression, can "induce passive support" in nondemocracies by altering political attitudes on national security, economic performance and distrust against social outgroups. Specifically, when ATLs are framed to target a highly identifiable outgroup - marked by distinct characteristics such as skin color or dialect - repression is perceived as being more selective and less arbitrary. This perceived selectivity of repression reduces uncertainty among the ingroup, leading to more support for government response against terrorism and a heightened antagonism toward social outgroups. With a focus on Egypt and Tunisia, I employ various empirical strategies including automated text analysis of ATLs, natural experiment and a novel survey experiment conducted in Tunisia. 

## Working Papers (Under Review)

* **Exporting Autocrat’s Playbook? Diverging Impacts of China and Russia on Contemporary Democratic Backsliding (with Woojeong Jang)**
  :   What roles do China and Russia play in contemporary backsliding? Under what conditions do they succeed or fail in spreading illiberal practices? Conducting difference-in-differences analyses, we contend that Chinese governance model, digital authoritarianism, has increasingly spread to the periphery of the dominant international order after 2014 while the Russian model of super-presidentialism, once prevalent in the former Soviet bloc, has experienced significant setbacks after 2014 due to Russia’s growing reputation as a security threat.

* **Observing Unrest Next Door: Evidence from a Natural Experiment of Mahsa Amini Protests in Iran (_Under Review_)**
  :   While Mahsa Amini’s death in Iran 2022 sparked massive wave of protests and drew significant international attention, these events did not resonate significantly within neighboring Arab countries. What impact, if any, did this incident have on Arab public opinion, if not altering political behavior? Bringing evidence from a natural experiment of an interrupted observational survey in Libya and Mauritania, I find that exposure to the protests briefly improved both institutional trust and perception of corruption among respondents. Social media, on the other hand, mitigated such effects as those with social media access were more likely to develop negative views of their domestic institutions after observing the protests. 
  
## Works in Progress

* **What Does Leaders’ Rhetoric Reveal About Foreign Policy? Automated Text Analysis of Nasser’s Speeches and Egyptian Foreign Policy Towards Palestine**
  :   Employing an automated text analysis of 393 speeches of Gamal Abdel Nasser from 1956 to 1970, the paper demonstrates a discernable shift in Nasser’s national role conception from a ‘pan-Arab leader’ to ‘Egyptian sovereign state’ following the Six-Day War in 1967, providing compelling explanation for the significant changes in Egyptian foreign policy towards Palestine.
