Vague Anti-Terrorism Laws and State Repression: Introducing a Novel Measurement of Vagueness in Terrorism Definitions 
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Why do some anti-terrorism laws (ATLs) result in greater repression than others? Despite growing concern over governments frequently exploiting vague and broad ATLs to suppress dissent, systematic evidence of their political consequences remains limited. To address this empirical gap, I develop a novel measurement of vagueness in terrorism definitions within domestic ATLs by incorporating text similarity scores with international standards, identifying the presence of “weasel words,” and assessing the inclusion of exclusionary clauses. I argue that ATLs with more vague definitions are more likely to result in higher levels of state repression upon enactment. My findings reveal that such laws are associated with increased violations of physical integrity, greater restrictions on civil liberties, and heightened media censorship compared to ATLs with precise definitions aligned with international standards. However, I find mixed results for digital repression, suggesting that online spaces may exhibit some resilience against autocratic overreach. This study deepens our understanding of how the legal language in security laws shapes democratic practices, offering new insights into the literature on counterterrorism and human rights.

Anti-Terrorism Laws and Popular Support: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Egypt
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When do repressive laws foster political support in nondemocracies? While existing literature often treats repression and co-optation as distinct strategies for authoritarian resilience – the former inciting fear and the latter cultivating loyalty – this paper delves into the nuanced role of selective repression in generating political support. With a regional focus on the Middle East and North Africa, I argue that vague anti-terrorism laws (ATLs), when linked to selective targeting, can mitigate fears of widespread repression, thereby fostering indirect support. Utilizing data from the Arab Barometer and Arab Opinion Index, I analyze patterns of political support across seven Arab countries and present evidence from a natural experiment in Egypt. I find that the enactment of Anti-Terrorism Law No. 94 (2015) led to an increase in indirect support for the regime and that the effect is marginal on outgroup distrust. By conducting a text analysis of the front-page headlines of _Al-Ahram_, I further demonstrate a discernible shift in the news coverage which increasingly emphasized security and legal topics in the post-ATL period.

Does Arab-Israeli Conflict Unite or Divide? Text Analysis of Nasser’s Speeches and Egyptian Foreign Policy Towards Palestine
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Does the Arab-Israeli conflict unite or divide Arab countries? Focusing on Egypt’s foreign policy orientation toward Palestine and Israel during the 1960s, this paper argues that the escalation of the Arab-Israeli conflict prompted a shift in Egypt’s identity under Gamal Abdel Nasser—from “Egypt as a revolution” to “Egypt as a state.” This challenges the prevailing perception of Nasser as the vanguard of Arab nationalism. Using automated text analysis of 393 speeches by Nasser (1956–1970), including sentiment analysis and structural topic modeling, I identify a discernible shift in the latent topics of his rhetoric. These findings provide a compelling explanation for the significant transformation in Egyptian foreign policy, which increasingly prioritized national interests over collective Arab interests. The results suggest that, despite the strong ideological influence of Arab nationalism in the 1960s, the Arab-Israeli conflict contributed to fragmentation among Arab countries. This study revisits the “End of Pan-Arabism” literature, offering new insights into national role conception and foreign policy analysis in the Middle East.
