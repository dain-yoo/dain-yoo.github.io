Anti-Terrorism Laws and Popular Support: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Egypt
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When do repressive laws foster political support in nondemocracies? While existing literature often treats repression and co-optation as distinct strategies for authoritarian resilience – the former inciting fear and the latter cultivating loyalty – this paper delves into the nuanced role of selective repression in generating political support. With a regional focus on the Middle East and North Africa, I argue that vague anti-terrorism laws (ATLs), when linked to selective targeting, can mitigate fears of widespread repression, thereby fostering indirect support. Utilizing data from the Arab Barometer and Arab Opinion Index, I analyze patterns of political support across seven Arab countries and present evidence from a natural experiment in Egypt. I find that the enactment of Anti-Terrorism Law No. 94 (2015) led to an increase in indirect support for the regime and that the effect is marginal on outgroup distrust. By conducting a text analysis of the front-page headlines of Al-Ahram, I further demonstrate a discernible shift in the news coverage which increasingly emphasized security and legal topics in the post-ATL period.
