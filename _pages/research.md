## Dissertation Project
* **Dictator’s Instrument for Security or Repression? Anti-Terror Law, Political Framing and Popular Support in Nondemocracies**
  :   Why do some anti-terror laws (ATLs) lend themselves to repression more than others? While numerous journalistic accounts denounce autocrats’ frequent use of _vaguely drafted_ security laws against political dissidents or ethno-religious minorities, systematic study of “vaguely drafted” ATLs and its association with increased repression is limited. I contend that the adoption of ATLs, followed by political framing of repression, can "induce passive support" in nondemocracies by altering political attitudes on national security, economic performance and distrust against social outgroups. Specifically, when ATLs are framed to target a highly identifiable outgroup - marked by distinct characteristics such as skin color or dialect - repression is perceived as being more selective and less arbitrary. This perceived selectivity of repression reduces uncertainty among the ingroup, leading to more support for government response against terrorism and a heightened antagonism toward social outgroups. With a focus on Egypt and Tunisia, I employ various empirical strategies including automated text analysis of ATLs, natural experiment and a novel survey experiment conducted in Tunisia. 

## Working Papers (Under Review)
* **The Invisible Impact of Conflict: A Study of Terrorism, Regime Type and the Shadow Economy (with Da Sul Kim, _Revise and Resubmit at International Interactions_)**
  :   Does terrorism contribute to the growth of the shadow economy? Employing data on terrorism and the shadow economies of 116 countries from 1990 to 2017, we demonstrate that terrorism results in an increase in the size of the shadow economy and that the effect is larger in autocracies. We argue that political instability caused by terrorism leads to the erosion of institutional trust and social capital. Furthermore, ineffective and repressive counterterrorism measures in autocracies further hamper the economic pursuits of individuals, businesses, and foreign investors, which facilitates engagement in informal economic activities. We use the generalized method of moments to deal with the endogeneity, which supports the findings.

* **Exporting Autocrat’s Playbook? Diverging Impacts of China and Russia on Contemporary Democratic Backsliding (with Woojeong Jang)**
  :   What roles do China and Russia play in contemporary backsliding? Under what conditions do they succeed or fail in spreading illiberal practices? Conducting difference-in-differences analyses, we contend that Chinese governance model, digital authoritarianism, has increasingly spread to the periphery of the dominant international order after 2014 while the Russian model of super-presidentialism, once prevalent in the former Soviet bloc, has experienced significant setbacks after 2014 due to Russia’s growing reputation as a security threat.


## Works in Progress
* **Observing Unrest Next Door: Evidence from a Natural Experiment of Mahsa Amini Protests in Iran**
  :   Bringing evidence of a natural experiment of an interrupted survey in Libya and Mauritania, I find that upon witnessing mass demonstrations in Iran during the Mahsa Amini protests results in an improved evaluation of their home institutions while exposure to social media crosses out such positive effects. Both effects are short-lived and delayed. 
  
* **What Does Leaders’ Rhetoric Reveal About Foreign Policy? Automated Text Analysis of Nasser’s Speeches and Egyptian Foreign Policy Towards Palestine**
  :   Employing an automated text analysis of 393 speeches of Gamal Abdel Nasser from 1956 to 1970, the paper demonstrates a discernable shift in Nasser’s national role conception from a ‘pan-Arab leader’ to ‘Egyptian sovereign state’ following the Six-Day War in 1967, providing compelling explanation for the significant changes in Egyptian foreign policy towards Palestine.
